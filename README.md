This repository documents my notes and code exercises from the [**Ultimate JavaScript Part 2: Advanced Topics**](https://codewithmosh.com/p/object-oriented-programming-in-javascript) course by Mosh Hamedani.

### ðŸ“… Course Timeline

* **Started:** September 24, 2024
* **Completed:** October 4, 2024

### ðŸŽ¯ About the Course

This course dives deep into **advanced JavaScript concepts** and object-oriented programming principles, building on the foundations of the language to prepare for real-world development and technical interviews. Topics covered include:

* Advanced JavaScript features: hoisting, closures, prototypal inheritance
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction
* ES6+ features: arrow functions, template literals, destructuring
* Modules and modern tooling: using module bundlers like Webpack
* Writing clean, maintainable code using best practices

### ðŸ’¡ Why I Took This Course

As a frontend developer, I wanted to **deepen my understanding of JavaScriptâ€™s inner workings** and improve how I structure large-scale codebases using object-oriented design. This course helped me solidify core JS concepts and adopt modern patterns that align with scalable and clean code practices.
